Model created by Kris Jensen (University of Cambridge) as Jupyter notebook in colab.

conc = True/False indicates concentric/retinotopic and is used to switch between "kinetic" and "static" model.
The "kinetic" model in the paper is here referred to as "concentric" as it relied on the concentric movement of the target to elicit movement.
The "static" model in the paper is here referred to as "retinotopic" as it uses the retinotopic location at time t of the target to produce movement.
